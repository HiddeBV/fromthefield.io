- **FR-010**: Expanded responsive design (touch targets, spacing, gestures, viewport zoom)

### New Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Performance Requirements (TTI, FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, bundle sizes, Lighthouse targets)
- **NFR-002**: Image Specifications (dimensions, formats, file sizes, srcset, lazy loading)
- **NFR-003**: SEO Requirements (Open Graph, Schema.org, sitemap, canonical URLs)
- **NFR-004**: Animation Specifications (timing, easing, reduced-motion, GPU acceleration)

### Expanded Edge Cases
- **EC-001**: Spotify embed failures (fallback player, messages)
- **EC-002**: Long content handling (truncation rules, tooltips)
- **EC-003**: Zero filter results (messages, reset button)

|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Functional Requirements | 15 | 24 | +9 (60% increase) |
| Non-Functional Requirements | 0 | 4 | +4 (new section) |
| Edge Cases | 6 (questions) | 10 (specifications) | +4 with detailed handling |
| Dependencies Documented | 0 | 4 | +4 (new section) |
| Quantified Requirements | ~40% | ~95% | +55% more measurable |
| Ambiguous Terms Resolved | 0 | 12+ | All vague terms clarified |

## Implementation Readiness

### ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed
- All checklist items validated (41/41)
- Specification is complete, clear, and consistent
- Requirements are testable and measurable
- Edge cases explicitly defined
- Dependencies and constraints documented
- No blocking ambiguities or conflicts

### üéØ Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ UX checklist validation - COMPLETE
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Begin Phase 1 (Setup) implementation from `tasks.md`
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Create Jekyll project structure
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Implement foundational HTML/CSS/JS

## Conclusion

The comprehensive UX requirements quality validation has significantly improved the specification quality. All 41 checklist items are now satisfied with detailed, quantified, and testable requirements. The specification is ready for implementation with clear guidance on:

- Visual design and hierarchy
- User interactions and feedback
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Performance and optimization targets
- Edge cases and error handling
- Technical constraints and dependencies

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation Phase 1 (Setup) as defined in `tasks.md`.
