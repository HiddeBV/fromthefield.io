**Feature Branch**: `001-formthefield-io-technical-podcast-landing-page-with-github-pages-hosting-featuring-episode-management-host-profiles-dark-light-mode-and-responsive-design-for-developers-architects-and-tech-consultants`  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "FormTheField.io - Technical Podcast Landing Page with GitHub Pages hosting, featuring episode management, host profiles, dark/light mode, and responsive design for developers, architects, and tech consultants"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Discover and Listen to Latest Episode (Priority: P1)

A developer visits the website to discover the podcast and listen to the most recent episode about consulting life in tech. They want to quickly understand what the podcast offers and start listening immediately.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - getting listeners engaged with podcast content. Without this, the website fails its primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage, seeing the latest episode, and playing it via the embedded player, delivering immediate podcast consumption value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they see the podcast name, tagline "Life as a Consultant in Tech", and a clear description of what the podcast offers
2. **Given** a visitor is on the homepage, **When** they scroll to the latest episode section, **Then** they see the featured episode with title, description, date, host/guest info, and an embedded Spotify player
3. **Given** a visitor wants to subscribe, **When** they look for subscription options, **Then** they see clearly visible buttons for Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and RSS feed

---

### User Story 2 - Browse and Filter Episode Library (Priority: P2)

A platform engineer wants to find episodes about specific topics like Kubernetes or DevOps. They need to search and filter through the episode archive to find relevant content.

**Why this priority**: Enables content discovery beyond the latest episode, increasing engagement and providing value to returning visitors seeking specific topics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the episodes page, applying topic filters, and viewing filtered results, delivering targeted content discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the episodes page, **When** they view the episode grid, **Then** they see episode cards with thumbnails, titles, dates, descriptions, topic tags, and host/guest avatars
2. **Given** a user wants to find specific topics, **When** they use the filter bar, **Then** they can filter by predefined topics like "Cloud Native", "Kubernetes", "DevOps", "Platform Engineering"
3. **Given** a user has applied filters, **When** they view results, **Then** only episodes matching the selected topics are displayed
4. **Given** a user clicks on an episode card, **When** the episode detail page loads, **Then** they see complete show notes, embedded player, and guest profiles

---

### User Story 3 - Learn About Hosts and Podcast Mission (Priority: P3)

A CTO wants to understand who hosts the podcast and the podcast's mission before deciding to recommend it to their team or consider being a guest.

**Why this priority**: Builds trust and credibility, important for audience growth and guest acquisition, but not critical for immediate content consumption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the about page and viewing host profiles and podcast mission, delivering credibility and trust-building information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is on the about page, **When** they read the podcast mission section, **Then** they understand what the podcast covers, who it's for, and what listeners will learn
2. **Given** a visitor wants to know about hosts, **When** they view host profiles, **Then** they see photos, names, titles, detailed bios, and social media links for each host
3. **Given** a visitor wants to connect with hosts, **When** they click social links, **Then** they can access LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and personal websites

---

### User Story 4 - Contact and Guest Inquiries (Priority: P4)

A tech consultant wants to inquire about being a guest on the podcast or ask questions about consulting topics covered in episodes.

**Why this priority**: Enables community engagement and guest pipeline, but not essential for core podcast consumption experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting the contact form and seeing confirmation, delivering communication capability with hosts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the contact page, **When** they fill out the contact form with name, email, and message, **Then** they can successfully submit their inquiry
2. **Given** a potential guest visits the contact page, **When** they see the "Interested in being a guest?" section, **Then** they understand how to apply and what information to provide

---

### User Story 5 - Personalized Viewing Experience (Priority: P3)

A developer prefers dark mode for late-night browsing and wants the website to remember their preference across visits.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience and accessibility, important for user retention but not critical for first-time visitors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling between dark and light modes and verifying preference persistence, delivering personalized viewing experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the website, **When** the page loads, **Then** the theme matches their system preference (dark/light)
2. **Given** a user clicks the theme toggle, **When** the mode changes, **Then** all page elements smoothly transition to the new theme
3. **Given** a user has set a theme preference, **When** they return to the website, **Then** their chosen theme is remembered
