## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories  
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all other stories but doesn't block them

### Within Each User Story

- Jekyll layout and component files before page-specific implementations
- CSS styling after HTML structure is complete
- JavaScript functionality after HTML/CSS foundation is established
- Story validation before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Component creation tasks within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch component creation for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create homepage hero section in index.html"
Task: "Add subscription buttons component in _includes/subscribe-buttons.html"

# Launch styling tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Add hero section styles in assets/css/main.css"
Task: "Add latest episode card styles in assets/css/main.css"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch page and component creation together:
Task: "Create episodes listing page episodes.html"
Task: "Create episode card component _includes/episode-card.html"
Task: "Create episode detail page episode.html"

# Launch styling tasks together:
Task: "Add episode grid styles in assets/css/main.css"
Task: "Add topic filter styles in assets/css/main.css"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T022)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently on homepage
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages for demo/feedback

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test episode browsing independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test about page independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test contact form independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test theming across all pages ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Homepage and latest episode)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Episodes browsing and filtering)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 & 4 (About page and contact form)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 60 tasks across 8 phases
- **Task Count per User Story**:
  - User Story 1 (P1): 7 tasks - Homepage and latest episode functionality
  - User Story 2 (P2): 10 tasks - Episode browsing and filtering system
  - User Story 3 (P3): 6 tasks - About page and host profiles
  - User Story 4 (P4): 6 tasks - Contact form and validation
  - User Story 5 (P3): 5 tasks - Dark/light theme system
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 26 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
- **Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear validation steps for standalone testing
- **Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (7 tasks after setup/foundation) - Complete homepage with latest episode
- **Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

**MVP Development Time**: Approximately 1-2 weeks for User Story 1 after foundation
**Full Feature Development Time**: Approximately 3-4 weeks for all user stories
**Team Parallel Development**: Can reduce timeline to 2-3 weeks with multiple developers
